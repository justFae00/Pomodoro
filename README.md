# Pomodoro Timer

A simple pomodoro timer in html, css and javascript. This project was inspired by [60minuteJavaScript](https://github.com/AyushSaini00/60minuteJavaScript) repository.

Abilities:
  1. Has 3 predetermined timings: 25m for working, 10m long break and 5m for short break.
  2. Pause/start and reset are available.
  3. Alarm audio is played when the timer is done. (mute option is available) audio from [mixkit](https://mixkit.co/)
  4. A soft animation is on infinite play.

!Might add a setting to change timings and alarm audio.
